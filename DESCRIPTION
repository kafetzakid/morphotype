Description: The morphotype package provides a pipeline from shape data extraction to typological arrangement of pottery profiles.
    The process requires as input the 2D technical drawings of the profiles and the height of the rim. 
    The package allows isolation of the wall profile and includes quantification based on (i) a set of gemometric meaures, (ii) one dimansional profile outline, (iii) two-dimensional profile outline and (iv) the wall profile.
    It incorporates dissimilarity computation based on distance metrics, combination of different form quantification methods, fuzzy clustering and fuzzy shape desciptors formulation.
